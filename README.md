AI Agent plays flappy bird game!

Contents of agent.ipynb:

1. Pre-processing
2. Convolutional Neural Network
3. Deep Q-learning/LSTM agent

CNN -> classify images
DQL/LSTM -> experimental method where the agent tries to find an optimal sequence of images to train the CNN on,
rather than giving the CNN the entire train set at a time to train on.
